          <p>
            Tiny Treasures was founded by passionate parents committed to giving our pre-schoolers the best possible start in life.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Tiny Treasures, we believe every child is a unique individual, full of potential, with their own strengths and interests. Our home-based early learning programme provides a warm, secure, and enriching environment where children can learn, grow, and thrive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Children are encouraged to explore, imagine, and discover at their own pace, while building strong, trusting relationships with their caregivers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We prioritise small group settings to ensure each child receives focused attention and personalised learning. Visit our <a href="/gallery">Gallery</a> to see some of our recent learning moments.
          </p>
          <p>
